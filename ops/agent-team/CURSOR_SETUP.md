# Cursor Setup (Agent Team)

## How to use
1) Open `ops/agent-team/team_plan.md`
2) Start a new Cursor chat and paste one of the recommended prompts from:
   `ops/agent-team/agent_team_spec.v1.yaml` → `cursor_integration.recommended_cursor_prompts`

## Default lead
- Always start with @teamlead_orchestrator (GPT-5.2 Thinking)
- Implementers only act on scoped workstreams

## Safety
- Any destructive op requires explicit confirmation
- Follow approval rules in `policy_approval_rules.yaml`
